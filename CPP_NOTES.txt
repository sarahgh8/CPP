The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
for learning OOP. We decided to choose C++ since itâ€™s derived from your old friend C.
Since C++ is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
follow the C++98 standard.

compiling: c++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=c++98
format: ex00 - ex01 - ex02, and so on...
class names = in UpperCamelCase format
Class name and file name must match
No norminette! but still it has to be understandable
the using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden
